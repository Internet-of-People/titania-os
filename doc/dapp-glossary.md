# Titania App Definition File
Each dapp on titaniaOs has a defined json manifest. An example of such a manifest is given below.

## Example: 

```
{
"id": "org.navcoin.wallet",
  "name": "NavCoin",
  "description": "NavCoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of NavCoin is carried out collectively by the network. NavCoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls NavCoin and everyone can take part.",
  "website": "https://navcoin.org/",
  "repository": "https://gitlab.libertaria.community/titania/dApp",
  "logo": "https://navcoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logo-mark.png",
  "labels": [
    "wallet"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "community"
  ],
  
  "ports": [{
    "name": "http",
    "port": 80,
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "type": "local"
  },
    {
      "name": "https",
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "type": "local"
    },
    {
      "name": "navcoin",
      "port": 44440,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "type": "public"
    },
    {
      "name": "rpc",
      "port": 44444,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "type": "local"
    }],
  "env": {},
  "volumes": ["/home/stakebox/.navcoin4"],
  "image": "libertaria/navcoin:latest"
  "staticpath": "/var/www/navcoin"
  }
  ```

Let us break down the above json in the following sections.

## Dapp Manifest Glossary

### Id*

The unique id for a the service. The name needs to be unique across the whole of titania.

App names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.

Top-down naming system is used. As companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their app namesâ€”for example, com.example.myapp for a app named myapp created by a programmer at example.com.

```
"id": "org.navcoin.wallet",
```

## Image*

The images must be available on a publically accessible docker registry like [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com).

```
"image": "libertaria/navcoin:latest"
```

If you want to test iterations of changes to the repo, you can use a specific hash or tag rather than latest.

```
"image": "libertaria/navcoin:memfixes"
```


### Meta Data

These details are used as meta data in the titania app store to display the app correctly.
*  name - name of the app
*  description - a short description explaining what the user is installing. And why he should install your app.
*  website - the web papge where the user can find out more about the app
*  repository - where the code is hosted for the app Container.
*  logo - A image to display for the app. The image hosted that is reachable through the internet.

"name": "NavCoin",
"description": "NavCoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of NavCoin is carried out collectively by the network. NavCoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls NavCoin and everyone can take part.",
"website": "https://navcoin.org/",
"repository": "https://gitlab.libertaria.community/titania/dApp",
"logo": "https://navcoin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logo-mark.png",
  ```

### Labels

Used to explain the function of the app.

```
  "labels": [
    "wallet"
  ]
```

### Tags*

Used to catogorize apps. 

* Helper - Apps that are required by other dapps to run.
* Core -  Apps made by the titania team that are core to titania, currently the IoP Stack.
* Community - Apps developed by the community. 

*Dapps you add should have the community tag*

```
  "tags": [
    "community"
  ]
```

### Ports*

Ports can be exposed out of the container by defining them in the ports sections. 

A port definition is made up out of 4 fields:

* name - the name of the port 
* port - the port to expose
* protocol - currently we support tcp. But in future udp might be added.
* type
    * internal
    * local - this port is only by the titaniOS
    * public - this port is exposed to the outside world.

*Mapping ports container ports to different port on titania is not possible at present.*

```
"ports": [{
    "name": "http",
    "port": 80,
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "type": "internal"
  },
    {
      "name": "https",
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "type": "internal"
    },
    {
      "name": "navcoin",
      "port": 44440,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "type": "public"
    },
    {
      "name": "rpc",
      "port": 44444,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "type": "local"
    }]
```
## Environment Variables

Enviroment Variables can be injected into the container to set cetain values in the container.

Titania has a couple injected into the container automatically for all containers.

* LATITUDE
* LONGITUDE
* EXTERNAL_IP

Here is an example of an environment declaration.
```
"env": {
  "CLIENTPORT": {
    "value": 16981,
    "description": "TCP port to serve client (i.e. end user) queries. Optional,default value: 16981"
  }
}
```

## Volumes and Permissions

If the dockerized app needs persitant storage on titania. The volumes that need to be persisted can be added. 

```
  "volumes": ["/home/stakebox/.navcoin4"],
  "volumechown": 1000
```

## Staticpath

Titania is able to serve static content for your dapp.

Here is the precedence on this url ``titania.local/dapp/dapp_id/alpha/beta`` 
1. Helper dapp `nginx` goes to dapps static path directory and looks for /alpha/beta regular file. If found, it's what is ultimately served.
2. If there is no such file nginx requests /alpha/beta from the dapp's http server.

```
  "staticpath": "/var/www/navcoin"
```
