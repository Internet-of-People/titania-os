## Sections

### Id

The unique id for a the service. The name needs to be unique across the whole of titania.

App names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.

Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their app namesâ€”for example, com.example.myapp for a app named myapp created by a programmer at example.com.

```
"id": "org.navcoin.wallet",
```

## Image

The images must be available on a publically accessible docker registry like [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com).

```
"image": "libertaria/navcoin:latest"
```

If you want to test iterations of changes to the repo, you can use a specific hash or tag rather than latest.

```
"image": "libertaria/navcoin:memfixes"
```

### Ports

Ports can be exposed out of the container by defining them in the ports sections. 

A port definition is made up out of 4 fields:

* name - the name of the port 
* port - the port to expose
* protocol - currently we support tcp. But in future udp might be added.
* type - local port is only by the titaniOS, public is exposed to the outside world

*Mapping ports container ports to different port on titania is not possible at present.*

```
"ports": [{
  "name": "http",
  "port": 80,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "type": "local"
},
{
  "name": "https",
  "port": 443,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "type": "local"
},
{
  "name": "navcoin",
  "port": 44440,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "type": "public"
},
{
  "name": "rpc",
  "port": 44444,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "type": "local"
}]
```
## Environment Variables

Enviroment Variables can be injected into the container to set cetain values in the container.

Titania has a couple injected into the container automatically for all containers.

* LATITUDE
* LONGITUDE
* EXTERNAL_IP

```
"env": {
   "MY_ENV" : "VALUE"
}
```

## Volumes

If the dockerized app needs persitant storage on titania. The volumes that need to be persisted can be added. 

```
  "volumes": ["/home/stakebox/.navcoin4"]
```
